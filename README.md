Meal App - Vanilla JavaScript Project
This project is a Meal App built using only Vanilla JavaScript, with no external libraries or frameworks. It allows users to search for meals, add them to favorites, and view detailed information about each meal. Additionally, users can access a page to view and manage their favorite meals, which are persistent across sessions.

Home Page
The Home Page allows users to search for meals using the search bar. As users type their query, search suggestions are dynamically updated, similar to Google's suggestions. Each search result displays the meal's name and has a "Favorite" button. Clicking on the "Favorite" button adds the meal to the user's list of favorite meals.

When users click on any particular search result, they are redirected to a new page, the Meal Detail Page, which shows more information about that meal.

Meal Detail Page
The Meal Detail Page provides detailed information about a selected meal. It includes the meal's name, photo, instructions, and other relevant details. Users can access this page by clicking on any search result on the Home Page.

My Favourite Meals Page
The My Favourite Meals Page displays a list of all the user's favorite meals. This list is persistent, meaning it remains the same even after closing or refreshing the browser. Each meal in the list has a "Remove from Favorites" button, clicking on which will remove the meal from the list of favorites.
